I.Phase:Problem Statement and Presentation
-
INTRODUCTION

The Children Welfare Management System is an Oracle PL/SQL-based database solution designed to manage the welfare, care, and development of orphaned and vulnerable children under the age of 18, with a special focus on those with disabilities. The system categorizes children into different sections (e.g., disabled, non-disabled) and supports their daily activities, medical care, education, and service tracking through centralized data management.

ðŸ“ŒProblem Definition:

Many child welfare centers (especially those caring for orphaned or abandoned children with disabilities) rely on manual record-keeping, resulting in data loss, inconsistent tracking, and poor coordination among caregivers, educators, and medical staff. There is a lack of a centralized, secure, and efficient system to manage childrenâ€™s welfare data â€” from medical history and educational progress to daily services received.

ðŸ”¹ Context:


This system will be used in child welfare centers, such as orphanages and social care institutions, where children under 18 â€” especially those with disabilities â€” receive long-term care, education, and health services. It replaces manual processes and fragmented records with a unified digital database managed through Oracle PL/SQL.


ðŸ”¹ Target Users:


âš«Social workers

âš«Healthcare providers

âš«Educators

âš«System administrators

âš«Orphanage management teams

These users will interact with the system to manage, update, and retrieve welfare-related information for each child.


ðŸ”¹ Project Goals:


âš«Automate workflows such as admission, section placement, service tracking, and education monitoring.

âš«Improve accuracy in record-keeping, ensuring all child-related data is stored consistently and reliably.

âš«Enhance data security through role-based access and auditing mechanisms.

âš«Increase efficiency in managing large volumes of information and reporting.

âš«Prevent scheduling conflicts, such as inserting records on public holidays, using intelligent triggers.


**II. Phase: BUSINESS PROCESS MODELING
--
âœ… Scope of the Business Process: Child Admission Process


This business process models the admission of a child into a child welfare center using a Management Information System (MIS). It outlines how data is collected, stored, and reviewed before a child is officially admitted into the system. The process ensures that all information is verified and approved through structured interaction between social workers, the MIS database, and administrators.


âœ… Objectives and Expected Outcomes:
OBJECTIVES:

âš«Ensure accurate collection of child information.

âš«Digitally store all admission data into the MIS database.

âš«Verify and approve admissions through a structured review process.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:


âš«A validated, complete record of each child in the system.

âš«Proper classification of children into appropriate care sections.

âš«Enhanced decision-making based on accurate and accessible data.



âœ… Brief Description of the BPMN Diagram:


The diagram visualizes the Child Admission Process across three swimlanes:

âš«Social Worker: Begins the process by collecting the childâ€™s information and submitting it to the system.

âš«Database (MIS): Stores the information and initiates a check for admission approval. If the data is incomplete or invalid, the system generates a report for review.

âš«Administrator: Reviews the report and makes a final decision. If approved, the child is admitted; if not, the process loops back for correction.





**III. Phase: LOGICAL MODEL DESIGN


This is a logical model design of my system.

1.Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

1.1.ðŸ”¹ Entities, Attributes, Data Types, and Keys


ðŸŸ© sections

| Attribute     | Data Type    | Key / Constraint |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |

âœ… 2. Relationships & Constraints

| Relationship                      | Type | Description                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| One section â†’ many children       | 1\:M | One section contains multiple children                 |
| One child â†’ one education record  | 1:1  | Each child has one main education record               |
| One child â†’ many support services | 1\:M | A child can receive many services                      |
| One staff â†’ many support services | 1\:M | One staff member can provide services to many children |


ðŸ”’ Constraints Used:


ðŸŸ¢NOT NULL for essential fields (e.g., child names, gender)

ðŸŸ¢UNIQUE for section names and staff contact numbers

ðŸŸ¢CHECK constraints for valid gender and disability_status

ðŸŸ¢DEFAULT value for service_date (set to SYSDATE)


âœ… 3. Normalization (to 3NF)


| Normal Form | How Itâ€™s Achieved                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1NF**     | All attributes hold atomic values; no repeating groups    |
| **2NF**     | All non-key attributes fully dependent on the primary key |
| **3NF**     | No transitive dependencies; all fields depend only on PK  |

âœ… Result: All tables are fully normalized to 3NF

âœ… 4. Handling Data Scenarios

This model can handle:

ðŸŸ¢Children assigned to specific sections (disabled, non-disabled)

ðŸŸ¢Children with or without disabilities

ðŸŸ¢Children enrolled in different schools and grade levels

ðŸŸ¢Staff assigned to children for various support services

ðŸŸ¢Logging multiple services per child

ðŸŸ¢Restricting insertions on public holidays using triggers

ðŸŸ¢Generating reports via packages/procedures
