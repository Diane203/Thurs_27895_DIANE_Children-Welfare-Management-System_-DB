INTRODUCTION

The Children Welfare Management System is an Oracle PL/SQL-based database solution designed to manage the welfare, care, and development of orphaned and vulnerable children under the age of 18, with a special focus on those with disabilities. The system categorizes children into different sections (e.g., disabled, non-disabled) and supports their daily activities, medical care, education, and service tracking through centralized data management.

ðŸ“ŒProblem Definition:

Many child welfare centers (especially those caring for orphaned or abandoned children with disabilities) rely on manual record-keeping, resulting in data loss, inconsistent tracking, and poor coordination among caregivers, educators, and medical staff. There is a lack of a centralized, secure, and efficient system to manage childrenâ€™s welfare data â€” from medical history and educational progress to daily services received.

ðŸ”¹ Context:


This system will be used in child welfare centers, such as orphanages and social care institutions, where children under 18 â€” especially those with disabilities â€” receive long-term care, education, and health services. It replaces manual processes and fragmented records with a unified digital database managed through Oracle PL/SQL.

ðŸ”¹ Target Users:


âš«Social workers

âš«Healthcare providers

âš«Educators

âš«System administrators

âš«Orphanage management teams

These users will interact with the system to manage, update, and retrieve welfare-related information for each child.

ðŸ”¹ Project Goals:


Automate workflows such as admission, section placement, service tracking, and education monitoring.

Improve accuracy in record-keeping, ensuring all child-related data is stored consistently and reliably.

Enhance data security through role-based access and auditing mechanisms.

Increase efficiency in managing large volumes of information and reporting.

Prevent scheduling conflicts, such as inserting records on public holidays, using intelligent triggers.
